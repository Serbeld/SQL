Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:

SQL code used to arrive at answer: SELECT COUNT(*)
                                   FROM table

	
        i. 	Attribute table =		10000
	ii. 	Business table =		10000
	iii. 	Category table =		10000
	iv. 	Checkin table =			10000
	v. 	elite_years table =		10000
	vi. 	friend table = 			10000
	vii. 	hours table =			10000
	viii. 	photo table = 			10000
	ix. 	review table = 			10000
	x. 	tip table = 			10000
	xi. 	user table =			10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

SQL code used to arrive at answer: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(key))
                                   FROM table

        
        i. 	Business =			10000 	(id)
	ii. 	Hours =				1562 	(business_id)
	iii. 	Category =			2643    (business_id)
	iv. 	Attribute =			1115	(business_id)
	v. 	Review =			10000	(id),		8090 (business_id), 	9581 (user_id)
	vi. 	Checkin = 			493 	(business_id)
	vii. 	Photo =				10000	(id),		6493 (business_id)
	viii. 	Tip = 				537	(user_id),      3979 (business_id)
	ix. 	User = 				10000	(id)
	x. 	Friend = 			11	(user_id)
	xi. 	Elite_years =	                2780	(user_id)
		

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?
        
       Answer: No
		
	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	     From the table below, we can see larger number of fans is not necessarily correlated with larger number of reviews. 
             For example, Gerald has the most reviews(2000), but Gerald has only 253 fans. 
		
		SQL code:
			SELECT name, review_count, fans
			FROM user
			ORDERBY fans desc
			limit 10
		
		Results:
			+-----------+--------------+------+
			| name      | review_count | fans |
			+-----------+--------------+------+
			| Amy       |          609 |  503 |
			| Mimi      |          968 |  497 |
			| Harald    |         1153 |  311 |
			| Gerald    |         2000 |  253 |
			| Christine |          930 |  173 |
			| Lisa      |          813 |  159 |
			| Cat       |          377 |  133 |
			| William   |         1215 |  126 |
			| Fran      |          862 |  124 |

SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT
  b.name
, b.city
, c.category
, b.stars
, h.hours,
  b.review_count,
  b.address,

FROM (business b INNER JOIN category c ON b.id = 
c.business_id) INNER JOIN hours h ON h.business_id =b.id
WHERE b.city = 'Toronto' AND c.category = "Food"
GROUP BY b.stars
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
   
   The businesses that are open tend to have more reviews than business that are closed on average.       
         
ii. Difference 2:

   The businesses that are open tend to be listed as 'funny' or 'useful' than business that are closed on average.  
         
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

Make a prediction about whether the business will be open or closed based on the reviews and stars.
         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:


Number of reviews, star rating of business and the city are important factors which are associated with the status of the business. Therefore, Number of reviews, star rating of business and city are included in the predection model.
                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
